# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft Surface Damage Classification and Captioning

This project combines **deep learning for image classification** and **vision-language modeling** to identify and describe aircraft surface damage such as **dents** and **cracks**.  
It leverages **VGG16** (a pretrained CNN model) for damage detection and **BLIP Transformer** for automatic image captioning and summarization.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The aviation industry requires quick and accurate detection of surface damage to ensure flight safety and reduce downtime.  
This project demonstrates how AI can automate damage assessment by:

1. **Classifying aircraft surface images** as either:
   - `Dent`
   - `Crack`

2. **Generating descriptive captions** and a **summary** using a pretrained BLIP transformer model.

## üß† Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Images of aircraft surfaces are resized and normalized.
- Labels are encoded into categorical form.
- Data augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, etc.) improve model generalization.

### 2. **Feature Extraction with VGG16**
- A pretrained **VGG16** network (from ImageNet) is used as a **feature extractor**.
- The final fully-connected layers are replaced with a custom classifier to distinguish between ‚ÄúDent‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrack‚Äù.

### 3. **Training and Evaluation**
- The model is trained using transfer learning to minimize computational cost.
- Evaluation metrics include **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrix** visualization.

### 4. **Caption and Summary Generation**
- A **BLIP Transformer** (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining) is used to generate:
  - A **caption** describing the detected aircraft image.
  - A **summary** that contextualizes the visual content.
